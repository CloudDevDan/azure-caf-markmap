## Azure Cloud Adoption Framework – Executive Summary

The Azure Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) is Microsoft’s proven guidance to help organisations successfully plan and implement their move to the cloud. Whether you're just starting out, modernising legacy systems, or scaling operations, CAF offers a structured approach that aligns technical decisions with business goals.

CAF breaks cloud adoption into clear, actionable phases - Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt, Govern, Secure, and Manage - so teams can progress with clarity, confidence, and control. It also provides tools, templates, and best practices that reduce risk and accelerate results.

CAF is not only about adopting cloud technologies - it's also about ensuring long-term success through strong governance, security, ongoing management, and continual optimisation. It supports the full lifecycle of cloud usage, from initial business case to sustained operations and innovation.

**Why it matters:**  
Cloud adoption can be complex. Without a strategy, misaligned teams and fragmented technologies lead to failed projects, spiralling costs, and poor outcomes. CAF helps you avoid these pitfalls by providing a unified framework that brings together stakeholders, IT, and the business.

### 📋 Strategy

**Define the “why” behind your cloud journey.**  
The Strategy phase helps your organisation identify business motivations, establish cloud objectives, and align stakeholders. By understanding desired outcomes and organisational priorities, you can ensure cloud adoption efforts deliver measurable business value.

---

### 📅 Plan

**Turn your strategy into a clear, actionable roadmap.**  
Plan focuses on preparing for cloud adoption by assessing existing assets, forecasting costs, identifying skill gaps, and prioritising workloads. It helps define what needs to move, in what order, and what support structures are required.

---

### 🛠️ Ready

**Set up a secure and scalable foundation.**  
Before migrating workloads, this phase ensures your Azure environment is ready. It includes designing landing zones, setting up governance and security controls, and aligning operations and access management. Ready establishes a repeatable, compliant infrastructure baseline.

---

### 🚀 Adopt

**Migrate and modernise workloads to realise cloud value.**  
Adopt provides guidance on migrating existing assets and modernising applications. It includes detailed steps across preparation, assessment, deployment, and release. The phase also covers how to innovate with cloud-native technologies post-migration.

---

### 🔐 Govern

**Maintain control and compliance in the cloud.**  
Govern defines policies, processes, and guardrails to manage risks and ensure compliance across your cloud environment. It’s about balancing speed and flexibility with control, through policy enforcement, cost management, and continual monitoring.

---

### 🛡️ Secure

**Protect your assets with cloud-native security.**  
Secure helps you build a comprehensive security strategy integrated across all CAF phases. It includes guidance on identity, network, and data protection, threat detection, and security posture management to ensure workloads remain safe and compliant.

---

### ⚙️ Manage

**Operate and support cloud solutions reliably at scale.**  
Manage focuses on the day-to-day operations of your cloud environment. It includes best practices for monitoring, automation, cost optimisation, incident response, and service health - ensuring your cloud investments are sustainable and well-managed.

---

### 🧭 Organise

**Align people and teams to enable successful cloud adoption.**  
Organise helps you define the roles, responsibilities, and team structures needed to support your cloud journey. It outlines critical cloud functions - like strategy, governance, platform, operations, and automation - and ensures the right people are in place, with the right skills, to carry them out.

This section underpins all Methodologies by:

- Empowering Strategy with leadership and stakeholder alignment  
- Supporting Planning through skills readiness and team accountability  
- Enabling Ready and Adopt phases by assigning roles to implement landing zones, manage workloads, and execute migration  
- Strengthening Govern and Secure by establishing functions that own policy and risk management  
- Sustaining Manage with clear operational responsibilities and support structures  

Without well-defined teams and organisational alignment, even the best technical plans can fail. Organise ensures your people are prepared, aligned, and capable of driving each phase of CAF forward.
